# Costco Wholesale Corporation Supply Chain Dashboard üìä

## 1. Information on Open-Source Data

For this project, we used **open-source data** from **Kaggle**, a platform for data enthusiasts to share and work with real-world datasets. Specifically, we worked with a **Supply Chain Dataset for Retail Businesses**, which contained the following information:

- **Product Categories**: Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies
- **Order Details**: Order ID, Order Date, Shipping Date, Shipping Mode
- **Customer Details**: Customer ID, Name
- **Sales Metrics**: Sales, Quantity, Discounts, and Profit

The dataset was chosen because it closely resembles the kind of data Costco would deal with on a daily basis.

## 2. Purpose and Goals üéØ

Our primary purpose was to create a dashboard that helps **Costco Wholesale Corporation** better understand its supply chain operations. This dashboard serves as a **data-driven decision-making tool** to achieve the following goals:

- üì¶ **Visualize key metrics** like sales, shipping, and profitability.
- üîç **Track operational performance** for better resource allocation.
- üìä **Simplify decision-making** by presenting complex data in an easy-to-digest format.

## 3. Key Questions on the Data ‚ùì

To guide the analysis, we focused on three main questions:

1. **What are the total sales and profit trends across different product categories?**
2. **How does the mode of delivery affect profitability and shipping efficiency?**
3. **Which customer segments generate the most revenue, and how do they prefer to receive their products?**

These questions were designed to address Costco‚Äôs operational efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction.

## 4. Metrics and KPIs üìä

We defined several metrics and **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to track Costco‚Äôs operational and strategic objectives:

- **Total Sales**: This helps assess overall revenue generation.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Calculated by dividing total sales by the number of orders to understand customer spending behavior.
- **Profit Margin**: This shows the company‚Äôs profitability by analyzing total profit relative to sales.
- **Sales by Category**: Helps identify high-demand products by showing a breakdown of sales by product category.
- **Sales by Mode of Delivery**: Displays the impact of different shipping methods on costs and profitability.

These KPIs give a clear picture of Costco‚Äôs performance and allow the company to adjust its strategy accordingly.
