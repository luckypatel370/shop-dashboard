## Information on Open-Source Data ℹ️

For this project, we used **open-source data** from **Kaggle**, a platform for data enthusiasts to share and work with real-world datasets. Specifically, we worked with a **Supply Chain Dataset for Retail Businesses**, which contained the following information:

- **Product Categories**: Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies
- **Order Details**: Order ID, Order Date, Shipping Date, Shipping Mode
- **Customer Details**: Customer ID, Name
- **Sales Metrics**: Sales, Quantity, Discounts, and Profit

The dataset was chosen because it closely resembles the kind of data Costco would deal with on a daily basis.

## Purpose and Goals 🛠️
At **Costco Wholesale Corporation**, maintaining operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability is crucial to sustaining their global retail leadership. The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive **executive dashboard** that offers a **visual and data-driven analysis** of Costco's supply chain operations.

The key goals of this dashboard are:
- Facilitate **informed decision-making** by visualizing essential supply chain metrics.
- Provide clear insights into critical areas such as **sales**, **shipping**, **customer segmentation**, and **profitability**.

This will allow Costco to track operational performance in real time, enhancing decision-making efficiency and supporting strategic goals.

## Key Questions for Data Analysis 🤔
To ensure that the dashboard provides valuable insights, we focused on the following key questions:
1. **What is the total sales volume, and how does it compare across different product categories?**
2. **How do different shipping methods affect profitability?**
3. **Which customer segments contribute the most to overall sales and profitability?**

---

## Metrics and KPIs 📈
Tracking the right metrics is critical for both operational and strategic decision-making. Below are the **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** we have defined:

- **Total Sales**: This metric tracks overall revenue and is key for evaluating the company's market performance.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: A measure of how much customers are spending per order, helping to gauge customer behavior and spending trends.
- **Profit Margin**: Shows the overall profitability by calculating the ratio of profit to total sales.
- **Sales by Category**: Analyzes which product categories (e.g., technology, furniture, office supplies) contribute the most to sales.
- **Sales by Mode of Delivery**: Compares the profitability and cost efficiency of different shipping methods (e.g., standard, express).

---

## Data Model 🗂️
Our data model was built using **Kaggle's Retail Dataset**, which includes a variety of important fields such as order details, shipping information, and customer data. These fields were combined to track **sales, shipping methods, and customer segmentation**.

The primary data fields used include:
- **Order ID, Order Date, Ship Mode**
- **Customer ID, Customer Name**
- **Product Category, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit**

---

## Results 🏅
The executive dashboard generated valuable insights into Costco's operations. Some of the key findings include:
- **High-demand product categories** like office supplies drove significant sales volume, but **technology** products had the highest profit margin.
- Shipping by **express mode** increased customer satisfaction but came at a higher cost, affecting the overall profit margin for certain categories.
- The **corporate customer segment** generated the highest revenue, while the **home office segment** had a higher average order value, showing strong spending potential.
